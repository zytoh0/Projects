We can sketch out the data science process as follows:
1. Define the problem.
2. Obtain the data.
3. Explore the data.
4. Model the data.
5. Evaluate the model.
6. Answer the problem.

In this project, we're going to focus on steps exploring data, building models and evaluating the models we build.

This project uses a chronic kidney disease dataset. You may find [this article](./chronic_kidney_disease.pdf) informative background reading. It's a bit shorter than five pages with about a full page of references and a decent number of graphs that take up space. Even though we haven't seen support vector machines (yet!), it's a good read and shockingly quick for an academic journal article.
