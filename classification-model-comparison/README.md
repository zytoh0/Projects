> Predicting Left-Handedness from Psychological Factors

We can sketch out the data science process as follows:
1. Define the problem.
2. Obtain the data.
3. Explore the data.
4. Model the data.
5. Evaluate the model.
6. Answer the problem.

We'll walk through a full data science problem in this lab. Specifically, we'll use a survey of psychological factors to predict whether or not individuals are left-handed. Along the way, we'll compare multiple classification models and see which best serve our needs.
